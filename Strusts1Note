yesterday,I read a vidio about javaee famework of strusts1.The belowing is my study note.
1\MVC review:
  m:model -------about operate DB,and javabean,Dao laday.
  V:view --------about jsp or html,js,css.dispaly program s imformation in a eyeing.
  C:control------about servlet.this is get the request,and by this logic code,deal with date.and response the jsp or html.
  
  advantage ï¼š this make distinct between the backstage code and the front end.the logic is very clear.
          but it alse has a little insufficent habits.for example,It codes the big program with a complex.and strusts1 have some 
          advantage.
 2\structs1 distribution request and config.
      structs1 likes a big serlvet class.
      it recieve a request by encapsulation a javabean.
      then action deal with the javabean,if the request is not error.
      by the config about web.xml,pro-config.xml,get the servletaction and path\the response.
      finaly,by the view delay,display the jsp.
